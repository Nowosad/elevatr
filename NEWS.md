elevatr 0.1.4 (2017-12-28)
==========================
## Bug Fixes
- Primary change with this released is fixing a bug with the return file type on the AWS and mapzen APIs.  "tif" was changed to "tiff" and the check was stopping processing of the raster images.  Details are on <https://github.com/jhollist/elevatr/issues/17>. Thanks to the following individuals for catching this: @yipcma, @TomBor, @jslingsby.  And thanks to @vividbot for <https://github.com/jhollist/elevatr/pull/18> which provided a fix.

    - Removed prettyunits
    - moved rgdal to suggests
    - Changed where ratelimitr getting called (was not in a function so couldn't be exported/called.
- Fixed travis build errors caused by change in elevation API that now requires a key.

elevatr 0.1.2 (2017-03-13)
==========================

## Bug Fix
- There was a typo in building the mapzen api key.  Was masked prior as a keyless access was allowed.  It no longer is and get_elev_raster was failing.  That has been fixed
- Tests also failing due to keyless access.  Encripted key now pushed for use on travis.  Tests not run on CRAN
- Thanks to @hrbrmstr for pointing me in the right direction on fixing the testing with an api key.
- Also thanks to @noamross and @ropensci for maintaing <https://discuss.ropensci.org> where I found <https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/test-api-wrapping-r-packages-with-oauth-tokens/157>.  And thanks to @jennybc for wrapping all this up and provide great guidance on testing and vignettes that require a key.  That info is here: <https://rawgit.com/jennybc/googlesheets/master/vignettes/managing-auth-tokens.html#encrypting-tokens-for-hosted-continuous-integration>
