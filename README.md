# elevatr
An R package for accessing elevation data from [Mapzen Tile Service](https://mapzen.com/documentation/terrain-tiles/) and the [Mapzen Elevation Service](https://mapzen.com/documentation/elevation/elevation-service/)

Two services available from Mapzen.com provide access to elevation data as a raster digital elevation model or as height at a single point.  This package provides access to those services and returns elevation data either as a data frame (from the Mapzen Elevation Service) or as a raster object (from the Mapzen Terrain Service).
