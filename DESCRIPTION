Description: Several web services are available that provide access to elevation
             data. This package provides access to several of those services and 
             returns elevation data either as a SpatialPointsDataFrame from 
             point elevation services or as a raster object from raster 
             elevation services.  Currently, the package supports access to the 
             Nextzen Terrain Service <https://tile.nextzen.org/tilezen/terrain/v1/>,
             Amazon Web Services Terrain Tiles <https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/terrain/> and the USGS
             Elevation Point Query Service <http://ned.usgs.gov/epqs/>.  The 
             elevation point service from Mapzen is no longer supported.  If a
             replacment is found it will be added.
