Description: Two services available from Mapzen.com provide access to elevation 
             data as a raster digital elevation model or as height at a single 
             point.  This package provides access to those services and returns
             elevation data either as a data frame (from the Mapzen Elevation 
             Service) or as a raster object (from the Mapzen Terrain Service).
