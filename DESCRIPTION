Description: Several web services are available that provide access to elevation
             data. This package provides access to several of those services and 
             returns elevation data either as a SpatialPointsDataFrame from 
             point elevation services or as a raster object from raster 
             elevation services.  Currently, the package supports access to the
             Mapzen Elevation Service, Mapzen Terrain Service, and the USGS
             Elevation Point Query Service.
